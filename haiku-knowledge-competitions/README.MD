# haiku-knowledge-competitions

Solutions to the Kaggle Knowledge Competitions in [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html), with [Haiku](https://dm-haiku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/basics.html). JAX is gaining popularity in research - it offers a functional, low-level API and is self-described as 'NumPy on the CPU, GPU, and TPU, with great automatic differentiation for high-performance machine learning research'. It is quite low-level, so it is useful to have higher-level neural network libraries such as Flax or Haiku on top of it. We also use Optax, from DeepMind, to manage optimisers.

add extra paragraphs about structure of project and how it differs to the Pytorch and JAX-FLAX projects.
