# torch-knowledge-competitions

Solutions to the Kaggle Knowledge Competitions in [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).
Pytorch is a popular framework for deep learning and is particularly widespread in research. It has a stable API and good documentation which make it great for developers.

## Training + Inference

The notebooks in ```torch-knowledge-competitions/experiments/``` contain code for training the models and generating predictions. Pre-trained models are not provided in this repository due to their large size, but they can be easily reproduced by running the notebooks.

## Submission

It is easiest to submit results with the Kaggle API, for example:
```bash
# submits preds.csv to the mnist classification competition
kaggle competitions submit -c digit-recognizer -f data/kaggle_mnist/preds.csv --message first_submission_with_api
```
Each notebook will contain instructions for each individual competition.
